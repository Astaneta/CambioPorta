> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
> - Craig F. Whitaker

The solution is that if you switch your choiche, you have 66% of possibility to win, instead 33% if you don't change. For check this, the following console program make 100.000
test without changing the choice and other 100.000 test changing it.
As you can see in the image, the test has confirmed (obviously) the solution
